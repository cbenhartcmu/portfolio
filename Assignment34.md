# Percentage of Active American Podcast Hosts on iTunes by Race and Gender (2010-2015)

I started here with a visualization from a Quartz article about the race and gender of iTunes podcasters in the U.S. I immediately thought that the title was unclear and the color choices could cause someone confusion because they incorrectly corresponded with gendered colors.

Then I made these images to test out some color and title changes.

To see whether my changes had lead to any more clarity for the visualization, I interviewed my family members.

- Can you tell me what you think this is? The sketches look like a representation of each race in the podcast industry.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you? The graph tells me what percentage of podcast are hosted by each race in the years 2010-2015.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? No but you need to look at American population breakdown so it’s better data. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this? Equality advocates, NAACP, colleges, podcasters. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? No I think it looks good other than the population not being included. I like the colors not separated by gender. Yellow and light blue hurts my eyes. 


Dad/Mom
 
- Can you tell me what you think this is? It’s a graph that shows the percentage of podcasts by race and gender, 2010-2015.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you? Most podcasts are from white males. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? I don’t find anything confusing, and it’s not surprising to me because I associate podcast with white males.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this? People who are interested in podcast, non-white people.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? Put data points at each year with a label. The primary colors might be more politically correct but I like the pink and blue better.

Using their feedback, I made this final visualization.
