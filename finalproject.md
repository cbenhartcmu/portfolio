My project is going to look into some possible ways forward for true crime, which over the last ten years has skyrocketed in popularity, but has recently come under fire for iffy racial politics and fearmongering.
I started out with the outline above, but simplified my story: I am looking to show the history of true crime and its growth as a genre, the racial demographics of podcasters, and then suggest some ways forward for true crime.
This will take the form of some slides that are more data visualizations and some that are more like an infographic.

As you can see by the marks on the initial sketches, I rearranged the information after getting feedback to better guide the narrative. I am starting off with an attention getting quote about which victims are seen as newsworthy. Then I will have an infographic about true crime history, a chart about podcast host gender, and suggestions to move forward. 

# Data

My primary data source is [this dataset about the gender of podcast hosts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9nFWbqNV6UA6h1XBPsxEyRtVNTY80xJS6yIjSeBVSc/edit#gid=45177727).
I will be adding more data as I go along about the rise of true crime media over the last ten years. 

# Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to build my short presentation. The charts will be made with Flourish and the data I already have, plus some other sources that I have yet to chart. I will bring together the infographic sections using Procreate and Canva. Once my visuals are complete, I plan to run them by some trusted friends, family, and peers to optimize and make sure I'm adequately addressing any questions that would pop up. After that, I will be practicing my presentation and preparing it for posting on this page.
