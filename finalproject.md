# Final Project


# Topic Selection
Since the pandemic began, more people than ever before have turned to true crime media for comfort and entertainment. However, with this increased visibility, the genre has attracted criticism. Detractors say that true crime decreases empathy, unnecessarily creates increased fear of crime, and normalizes graphic violence. I chose this topic because I, as a true crime fan who has started to have qualms myself, wonder how the genre can move forward.

I started out with the outline above, but simplified my story: I am looking to show the history of true crime and its growth as a genre, the racial demographics of podcasters, and then suggest some ways forward for true crime.
This will take the form of some slides that are more data visualizations and some that are more like an infographic.

Slide 1 - Quote: In order to be written about a murder must have all of the elements: la white, attractive female killed ina horrible way, in an interesting place
Slide 2 - Graph of the growth of true crime podcasts (backup tv true crime if podcast data isn't available)
Slide 3 - Infographic about the history of true crime
Slide 4 - Main problem for newsworthiness is racial lack of empathy. Will this Continue?
Slide 5 - Podcast Host Gender Graph
Slide 6 - Ways forward

As you can see by the marks on the initial sketches, I rearranged the information after getting feedback to better guide the narrative. I am starting off with an attention getting quote about which victims are seen as newsworthy. Then I will have an infographic about true crime history, a chart about podcast host gender, and suggestions to move forward. 

# Data

My primary data source is [this dataset about the gender of podcast hosts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9nFWbqNV6UA6h1XBPsxEyRtVNTY80xJS6yIjSeBVSc/edit#gid=45177727).
I will be adding more data as I go along about the rise of true crime media over the last ten years. 

# Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to build my short presentation. The charts I'm going to use will be made with Flourish and the data I already have, plus some other sources that I have yet to chart. I will bring together the infographic sections using Procreate and Canva. Once my visuals are complete, I plan to run them by some trusted friends, family, and peers to optimize and make sure I'm adequately addressing any questions that would pop up. After that, I will be practicing my presentation and preparing it for posting on this page.

# Critique

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story: true crime fans and people who are interested in learning more about the genre.
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; I interviewed four of the biggest true crime fans I know.
c/d. your interview script/results; 
Interviewees were asked: 
What do you think of my presentation?
  1 I thought it was really good/thoughtful/evenhanded.
  2 Great color and engaging format.
  3 Visually pleasing and easy to follow.
  4 The presentation is effective and succinct.
  
What story do you think I'm telling?
  1 Shifting perspectives of true crime for fan communities in the aftermath of COVID.
  2 Giving an overall idea of who watches true crime and what people think about it
  3 Telling the story of original history of true crimes, and its origin. How females engage more than any other group. I agree that the older I am, white female, the more crime I watch, I feel less empathy for those inflicted with violence against them.  I feel numb, or I have expectations of what is going to happen, since you kind of know what comes next in a patterned sequence of events.
  4 You are telling a story about most podcasts being produced by white men even though a majority of those engaging with the genre are female. Also shows lack of representation and diversity in the production of podcasts.
  
Do the visualizations get my point across?
  1 Yes, I think they're a highlight and illustrate your point.
  2 Yes, although I would make them larger to show that they're the highlight.
  3 Yes, I thought that the line graph was very effective.
  4 Yes, they look professional and clean, but there are a lot of colors and the data labels are hard to read.
  
Is there anything you particularly like or that you don't like about my presentation and visualizations?
  1 I think the visualizations are strong, made it easy for me to understand the thrust of the presentation.
  2 I really enjoyed the scroll through format.
  3 The pie graphs one after the other were very interesting for comparison.
  4 I would add more to the conclusion.
  
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 

I will be changing the relative size of the text and visualizations.
I will be creating a more cohesive color story.
I will explore better data labels. 
I will end on a call to action.
